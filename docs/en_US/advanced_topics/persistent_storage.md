# 4.2. Persistent Storage

Validators run the servers and the data is stored in persistent storage. As a consequence we need a tool for working with persistent storage and so we have added `linera-db` for that purpose.

## [Available persistent storage](https://linera-dev.respeer.ai/#/en_US/advanced_topics/persistent_storage?id=available-persistent-storage)

The persistent storage that are available right now are `RocksDB`, `DynamoDB` and `ScyllaDB`. Each has its own strengths and weaknesses.

- [`RocksDB`](https://rocksdb.org/): Data is stored on disk and cannot be shared between shards but is very fast.
- [`DynamoDB`](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/): Data is stored on a remote storage, that has to be on AWS. Data can be shared between shards.
- [`ScyllaDB`](https://www.scylladb.com/): Data is stored on a remote storage. Data can be shared between shards.

There is no fundamental obstacle to the addition of other persistent storage solutions.

In addition, the `DynamoDB` and `ScyllaDB` have the notion of a table which means that a given remote location can be used for several completely independent purposes.

## [The `linera-db` tool](https://linera-dev.respeer.ai/#/en_US/advanced_topics/persistent_storage?id=the-linera-db-tool)

When operating on a persistent storage some global operations can be required. The command line tool `linera-db` helps in making them work.

The functionalities are the following:

- `list_tables`(`DynamoDB` and `ScyllaDB`): It lists all the tables that have been created on the persistent storage
- `initialize`(`RocksDB`, `DynamoDB` and `ScyllaDB`): It initializes a persistent storage.
- `check_existence`(`RocksDB`, `DynamoDB` and `ScyllaDB`): It tests the existence of a persistent storage. If the error code is 0 then the table exists, if the error code is 1 then the table is absent.
- `check_absence`(`RocksDB`, `DynamoDB` and `ScyllaDB`): It tests the absence of a persistent storage. If the error code is 0 then the table is absent, if the error code is 1 then the table does not exist.
- `delete_all`(`RocksDB`, `DynamoDB` and `ScyllaDB`): It deletes all the table of a persistent storage.
- `delete_single`(`DynamoDB` and `ScyllaDB`): It deletes a single table of a persistent storage.

If some error occurs during the operation, then the error code 2 is returned and 0 if everything went fine with the exception of `check_existence` and `check_absence` for which the value 1 can occur if the connection with the database was established correctly but the result is not what we expected.
